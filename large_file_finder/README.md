# Large File Finder
A simple script that allows you to size up all the files and folders within a given directory, returning n top folders/files and allowing you to open parent directories to delete files.

```
run large_file_finder.py [path] [options]
```

| Options | Details | Example |
| --num_resuls | The number of top results you'd like to see (Default: 10). | run large_file_finder.py --num_results 15 |
| path | The path to the directory you want to size up (Default: user/Library) | run large_file_finder.py <path> |

### Features in Progress
- attempting to implement the script into a GUI for a better UX
